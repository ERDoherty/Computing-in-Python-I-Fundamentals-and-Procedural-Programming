    "### Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variables are names that hold some value. In prinicples of self-documenting code, we should ideally give names that suggest what the variable holds. There are both rules and conventions to naming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rule #1: variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters in python, only letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "Rule #2: variables must start with a letter\n",
    "Rule #3: variables cannot use reserved words (e.g., \"for\" or \"in\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Convention #1: use variable names that provide insight into what the variable contains\n",
    "\n",
    "##### We can't assign variables to values, we must assign values to variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python assigns variables with an equals sign while some other languages like R assign variables with different assignment operators ( <-)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Breaking programming rules \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to break programming rules would be by trying to use a variable that doesn't have a value assigned to it yet. If one were to do this, the computer would throw a \"null pointer exception\". In python, this will show as \"NameError\". \n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot assign values to one another either. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are able to assign `None` to variables. This will work differently than just not assigning values to variables (result in error). "
